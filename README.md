This project is a song recommendation system in which users enters the name of the song and number of similar songs he wants. The song recommendation system uses K-Means Clustering algorithm to classify similar songs into clusters and then generate random songs from the cluster in which the input song belongs. We are using flask for connecting the python backend to the frontend.
